1. Why is it better to calculate the gradient (slope) directly rather than numerically?

[X] It is computationally expensive to go back through the entire neural network and adjust the weights for each layer of the neural network.
[ ] It is more accurate.
[ ] There is no difference between the two methods.

2. What are the main neural network components that make up a Long Short Term Memory network?

[ ] New information and prediction.
[ ] Prediction, collected possibilities, and selection.
[X] Prediction, ignoring, forgetting, and selection.

3. How should you assign weights to input neurons before training your network for the first time?

[ ] From smallest to largest.
[X] Completely randomly.
[ ] Alphabetically.
[ ] None of the above.

4. When are Convolutional Neural Networks not useful?

[X] If your data can't be made to look like an image, or if you can rearrange elements of your data and it's still just as useful.
[ ] If your data is made up of different 2D or 3D images.
[ ] If your data is text or sound based.
